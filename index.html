              When I was 7 years old, I had my first contact of computer 4.86 with windows 3.11. I remember when I
              learned
              very fast
              just watching my uncles and my grandmother using it. Few days later I was using the computer without help.
              The time
              passed and my family had a hard time because my father lost his job, So I had to work early to help them.
              My
              passion for
              computers passed during this time because I could not have an opportunity to develop. When I was 18 years
              old, I earned
              a scholarship in Manager Production. That was not what I wanted but that was the only way to get a better
              job to help my
              family and save money to find what I love to do. Many years later working as a buyer in some companies and
              helping the
              IT department to bring solutions. The passion of technologic grew up again and I remember my first contact
              and how I
              felt. Now, 24 years later I have the opportunity to study and develop my skills.</p>
